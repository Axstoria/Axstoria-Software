We will also need a server hosted on our side for the STUN server, which needs to be available 24/7 in order to allow players to connect to each other.

-   The STUN server will use the COTURN implementation and will overall need only a few ressources to work

- Determine the exact needs for this server (hardware requirements, infrastructure, technical stack, …)
    

  

In the future, add the technical needs for the mobile application which will allow players to consult their character sheets.
